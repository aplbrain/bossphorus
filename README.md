<h6 align=center>Bossphorus implementation in Rust</h6>

This is a reimplementation of the [Bossphorus](https://github.com/aplbrain/bossphorus) codebase in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).


## Why?

It is bewildering how much faster this is than the Python implementation.


## Feature Parity

See [Feature Parity](docs/Features.md) for more information.

## Configuration

Environment variables have precedence over the `Rocket.toml` config file.

### Environment Variables

`BOSSHOST`: Sets the Boss DB host  
`BOSSTOKEN`: Token used for Boss auth


### Rocket.toml File

`bosshost`: Sets the Boss DB host  
`bosstoken`: Token used for Boss auth


### Defaults

In absence of an environment variable and value in the `Rocket.toml` file:

```
bosshost = "api.bossdb.io"
bosstoken = "public"
```


## Development

Blosc must be installed manually via a package manager to build.

For MacOS:

```shell
brew install c-blosc
```

For Ubuntu-like:

```shell
sudo apt install libblosc-dev
```


Due to use of the Rocket web server crate, the nightly Rust toolchain must be used. You can set this as your default with:

```shell
rustup default nightly
```
